          Your presence here is private. We collect only what we need to schedule sessions, send Zoom links, and keep your
          account in order — name, email, phone, and the notes you choose to share.

          Session notes and intake answers stay between you and Jackie. We do not sell personal information, and we do not
          use it for advertising.
